# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;

#First I determined the top 10 most popular songs and artists based off popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined the LEAST 10 most popular songs and artists based off popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 10;

#Determined the avg danceability by artist and track. 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#Determined what artist released the longest song.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, duration_ms
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Determined the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs.
SELECT track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;
